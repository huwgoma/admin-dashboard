# Admin Dashboard
Project: Admin Dashboard - Part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)'s course on CSS Grid. 

The goal of this project was to build an admin dashboard design. The provided example can be seen [here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png). While it is encouraged to experiment with personal design decisions, I chose to largely remain faithful to the provided example design, as I do not have much experience in the way of proper UI design principles, and I wanted to prioritize reinforcing the CSS Grid and Flexbox concepts that the lessons prior to this assignment had taught.
